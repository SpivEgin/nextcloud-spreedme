# How to run Spreed WebRTC with Apache in subpath

To support Spreed WebRTC with an Apache HTTP Server, you require at least Apache
version 2.4.5 to be able to proxy Websocket protocol. All current distributions
should have this in their repositories.

Make sure you have the `mod_proxy_wstunnel`, `proxy`, `proxy_http` and `headers`
modules enabled. On Ubuntu, this goes like this `a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel headers`.

Add the configuration section from below, to your Apache virtual host to make
available Spreed WebRTC below the `/webrtc` subpath. Note also that Spreed
WebRTC does require HTTPS and thus it only makes sense to use an TLS encrypted
virtual host.

## Apache configuration sniplet

```
    <Location /webrtc>
        ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8080/webrtc
        ProxyPassReverse /webrtc
    </Location>

    <Location /webrtc/ws>
        ProxyPass ws://127.0.0.1:8080/webrtc/ws
    </Location>

    ProxyVia On
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto 'https' env=HTTPS
```

## Spreed WebRTC subpath configuration

To let Spreed WebRTC know that it is running in a subpath, you need to set the
`basePath` configuration in the `[http]` section of your `server.conf`. Use the
same value as for the `<Location ...>` in the Apache configuration. So if you
use the example from above, make sure you have `basePath = /webrtc` in your
Spreed WebRTC `server.conf` and restart Spreed WebRTC after the change. Also
make sure you use the same ports for the `ProxyPass` lines in Apache as they are
set in the `server.conf` `[http]` `listen` setting.

## Done, now testing

Make sure to also reload the Apache HTTP server and the WebRTC server should
become available at https://yourserver/webrtc and is ready to be used from the
Nextcloud plugin.

That's it.
