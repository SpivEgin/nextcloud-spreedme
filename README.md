## Installation / Setup of this app

This set of installation steps assume that you already have set up Nextcloud using a web server like Apache or Nginx and will help you to set up Spreed WebRTC below the `/webrtc` subpath at your existing web server. If your Nextcloud server is not using SSL yet, you need to [enable SSL now](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/9/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#enabling-ssl-label). Spreed WebRTC does require an encrypted connection and
as this app is running within Nextcloud that means that your Nextcloud needs to
be accessed with HTTPS.

1. Place this app in the **apps/** folder of your Nextcloud installation.
2. Set up a Spreed WebRTC server and continue with the next step.
   An easy-to-follow installation guideline can be found further below, see [Installation / Setup of a Spreed WebRTC server](#installation--setup-of-a-spreed-webrtc-server). Make sure to get Spreed WebRTC 0.27 or newer.
3. You now should have a running Spreed WebRTC server.
4. Create a new folder **extra.d** in the root directory of Spreed WebRTC (e.g. `mkdir /absolute/path/to/spreed-webrtc/extra.d`). Now symlink the Nextcloud plugin into this folder, `ln -sf /absolute/path/to/nextcloud/apps/spreedme/extra /absolute/path/to/spreed-webrtc/extra.d/spreedme`
5. This app requires you to change some settings in the `server.conf` of the Spreed WebRTC server (`webrtc.conf` if you use the packaged version), namely:
   1. In the **[http]** section:
        Enable (= uncomment) **basePath** and set it to the basePath you determined above, e.g. **/webrtc/**
        (e.g. `basePath = /webrtc/`)
   2. In the **[app]** section:
      - Enable **authorizeRoomJoin** and set it to **true**
        (`authorizeRoomJoin = true`)
      - Enable **extra.d** and set it to the full absolute path to Spreed WebRTC's **extra.d** directory (the directory you created in step 4.)
        (e.g. `extra.d = /absolute/path/to/spreed-webrtc/extra.d`)
   3. In the **[users]** section:
      - Enable **enabled** and set it to **true**
        (`enabled = true`)
      - Enable **mode** and set it to **sharedsecret**
        (`mode = sharedsecret`)
      - Enable **sharedsecret_secret** and set it to a random 64-character HEX string
        **Please note:** Do **NOT** use the string given below. Generate your own random 64-character HEX string!
        You can generate your own 64-character HEX string by running `xxd -ps -l 32 -c 32 /dev/random` or `openssl rand -hex 32`
        (e.g. `sharedsecret_secret = bb04fb058e2d7fd19c5bdaa129e7883195f73a9c49414a7eXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)
   4. Restart the Spreed WebRTC server to reload its configuration
6. Head over to the **apps/spreedme/config** folder in your Nextcloud installation. Copy `config.php.in` to `config.php` and adjust the constants as already done in `server.conf`:
   1. Set `SPREED_WEBRTC_SHAREDSECRET` to the same **sharedsecret_secret** you set in the `server.conf` file before
7. Head over to the **apps/spreedme/extra/static/config** folder in your Nextcloud installation. Copy `OwnCloudConfig.js.in` to `OwnCloudConfig.js` and adjust the constants as already done in `server.conf` and `config.php`:
8. Enable this Nextcloud app by browsing to **/index.php/settings/apps**
9. **That's it.** You can now start communicating securely with your friends and family by opening the **Spreed.ME app** of your Nextcloud host in your browser.

## Limiting access to this app

- By default, all users who can log in to your Nextcloud installation can also use this app (and Spreed WebRTC).
- If you want to limit access to this app (and Spreed WebRTC) only to a selected user-group, open Nextcloud's user configuration site in your browser: **/index.php/settings/users**.
- Create a new group there (e.g. "spreed.me"). For sure you can also use an existing group (like "admin").
- Now go to Nextcloud's app configuration page **/index.php/settings/apps**, find this app and check **Enable only for specific groups**. Then add all groups which should be able to use this app.
- All users not in a group specified in the step above, will neither be able to use this app nor spreed-webrtc.

## Access by non-Nextcloud users

- If you want to use spreed-webrtc with users who do not have an Nextcloud account, you can enable the "Temporary Password" feature in `config/config.php`.
- This allows them to use spreed-webrtc with a "Temporary Password", which admins can generate by clicking on the key icon in the room bar of spreed-webrtc or at **/index.php/apps/spreedme/admin/tp**. Admins are either Nextcloud admins or Spreed.ME group admins. Create a group "Spreed.ME" and add users as a group admin for that group to allow them to generate "Temporary Passwords".

## Upgrading this app

1. Save the `config/config.php` and the `extra/static/config/OwnCloudConfig.js` file of your current **spreedme** apps directory.
2. Download a newer version of this app.
3. Replace the old folder with the new folder you just downloaded.
4. Copy back the two files (step 1) to the appropriate folders.
5. Consult CHANGELOG.md for changes you might need to follow.

## Installation / Setup of a Spreed WebRTC server

Minimum Spreed WebRTC version: **0.27.0**.

1. Head over to [github.com/strukturag/spreed-webrtc](https://github.com/strukturag/spreed-webrtc) and follow the instructions to install the Spreed WebRTC server.
   For a packaged version (preferred) see [github.com/strukturag/spreed-webrtc/wiki/Ubuntu-Repository](https://github.com/strukturag/spreed-webrtc/wiki/Ubuntu-Repository).
   You need to adjust your existing web server configuration to make Spreed WebRTC available in a subpath. Follow our guides for [Nginx](./doc/example-config-nginx.md) or [Apache](./doc/example-config-apache.md) on how to run Spreed WebRTC on the same host in a subpath.
2. **Don't forget** to set your own secrets in the **[app]** section of spreed-webrtc's config file. At the very least you should change **sessionSecret** and **encryptionSecret**.

## Debugging this app

- If you're having trouble getting this app and Spreed WebRTC server to run, simply open **/index.php/apps/spreedme/admin/debug** of your Nextcloud host in your browser.
  It might contain information which can help to debug the issue.
